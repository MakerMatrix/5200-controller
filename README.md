## Purpose

This is a custom controller for the Atari 5200 vintage gaming console. The 5200's original controller do not self center, which is consider by many to be a considerable drawback to the controllers. The fire buttons are also mushy, and the controller is generally unreliable unless rebuilt.

So I made my own.

## Programming the microcontroller

The microcontroller is an ATTINY85. Make sure to program both fuses.hex to the fuses, and 5200controller.hex to the program memory.

## Acknowledgements

Ben Heck has a similar project, in his video "Atari 5200: Making a Better Controller" that demonstrated the technique of using a microcontroller and digital pot to do the potentiometer scaling.
